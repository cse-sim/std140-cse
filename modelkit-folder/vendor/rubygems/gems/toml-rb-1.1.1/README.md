    $ gem install toml-rb

Parser Usage
------------

```ruby
require 'toml-rb'

# From a file!
path = File.join(File.dirname(__FILE__), 'path', 'to', 'file')
TomlRB.load_file(path)

# From a stream!
stream = <<-EOS
  title = "wow!"

  [awesome]
    you    = true
    others = false
EOS
TomlRB.parse(stream)
# => {"title"=>"wow!", "awesome"=>{"you"=>true, "others"=>false}}

# You want symbols as your keys? No problem!
TomlRB.load_file(path, symbolize_keys: true) 
# Works the same for TomlRB.parse
