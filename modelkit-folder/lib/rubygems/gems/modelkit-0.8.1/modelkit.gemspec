# The version number for this Gem is determined dynamically at build time from
# the tag in the Git repository and is saved in a top-level file named "version".
# The version number is also set in the Gemspec which then becomes the reference
# authority in the source code via `Gem.loaded_specs["gem-name"].version`.
#
# This approach deviates from the common practice of storing the version number
# directly in the source code (usually in version.rb) with the goals of:
# - Managing the version number independently as part of the build process
# - Making the version number more accessible to users and non-Ruby programs
# - Avoiding the pattern of having to load code to read the version number
# - Better supporting Semantic Versioning so that each build can have a unique
#   identifier with version number _and_ build label.
#
# RubyGems does not fully support Semantic Versioning yet because it does not
# allow special characters in the version string such as "-" or "+". This limits
# what can be done with a build label appended to the version number. As a
# workaround, a full SemVer string is generated and saved to a file while the
# numeric-only version string is used in the Gemspec. The build label is also
# stored separately in the Gemspec using the metadata attribute.
