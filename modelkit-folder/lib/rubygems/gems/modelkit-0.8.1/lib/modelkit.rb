module Modelkit

# NOPUB this is problematic if a user tries to load Modelkit by doing something like this:
#   $LOAD_PATH.unshift("#{__dir__}/../modelkit/lib")
#   require("modelkit")  # skips loading the file as a Gem; just loads the file
#
# problematic because doesn't add extra directories to $LOAD_PATH, e.g., spec.require_paths = ["lib", "vendor"]


# if Gem.loaded_specs fails, try Gem::Specification.load("#{__dir__}/../modelkit.gemspec")

# Gem::Specification.load => doesn't change $LOAD_PATH; doesn't add to Gem.loaded_specs

# I'm looking for whatever loads the gemspec and activates a gem

# this almost works:
#   spec = Gem::Specification.load("modelkit.gemspec")
#   spec.activate     # adds spec.require_paths and gem dependencies to $LOAD_PATH
# .... still need to require the Gem:  require("modelkit")    still doesn't work

# fails:   require("modelkit")

# may be beneficial so that it can be loaded as if it were a Gem, just by require'ing the file.
# set ups all the $LOAD_PATH stuff

# modelkit-energyplus hits the same problem just for unit tests during development

# upside of this, is that if I can fix it, some things like test.libs = ["lib", "test", "vendor"]
# in Rake::TestTask can be eliminated, i.e., if the gem is handling this itself
# test.libs is just repeating stuff from the gemspec (still needs "test" though).
