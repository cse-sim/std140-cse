# NOPUB Still not sure which is the right implementation: above or below?

# Convert an object to true/false based on Ruby "truthiness". `false` and `nil`
# evaluate to false, while any other value evaluates to true. The idiomatic but
# cryptic alternative is: `!!object`

# `Boolean` represents boolean data types (`true` and `false`) and acts as a
# contrived superclass for `TrueClass` and `FalseClass`. The class itself is
# empty and does not permit any instances to be created (much like other basic
# Ruby data types such as `Integer` and `Float`). One purpose of this class is
# to enable the validation of boolean values:
#
#     true.kind_of?(Boolean) => true
#     false.kind_of?(Boolean) => true
#
# `TrueClass` and `FalseClass` are gently monkey-patched to recognize the
# `Boolean` class as one of their ancestors so that `kind_of?` works.
# @see #Boolean Boolean factory method
