#puts "warning flag (-w) => #{$VERBOSE.inspect}"

# CONCLUSIONS:
# - unused variables and literal in conditional only get checked on parse and reported with -w.
#   $VERBOSE within the file can't turn it on or off.
# - $VERBOSE does turn on/off other interesting warnings; whether it's in ERB or not doesn't matter.
# - unused variables never get reported for ERB no matter what.
# - only sure way to get all the warnings (on demand) is to call `ruby -cw`.


# $VERBOSE _does_ work with ERB. It happens on .result call.
#   nil turns off all warnings; false only sets the level to 1 (still some warnings)
#   true turns on all warnings (level 2), regardless of what the CLI flag was.
#   "assigned but unused variable" never seems to get reported from ERB either way.
$VERBOSE = true


my_var = 99  # gives warning, but only if -w flag is used

# Strangely the above does not give a warning unless -w is set in CLI.

#eval("z = 333; if (z = 3); end")  # this even gets detected correctly, but not unused var

x = 3
if (x = 4); end  # setting $VERBOSE nil does NOT turn of this warning :(
