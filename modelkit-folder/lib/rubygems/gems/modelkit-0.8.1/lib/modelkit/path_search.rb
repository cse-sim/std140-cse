# NOPUB This is a cool pattern from https://github.com/thomasbaustert/search_path
# Define the search paths. Search paths are considered in the order given; first given, first searched.
#   search_path = SearchPath.new(["/custom/path/to/files", "/standard/path/to/files"])
#
# Case 1: File not in "/custom/path/to/files" but in "/standard/path/to/files":
#   search_path.find("template.erb") # => "/standard/path/to/files/template.erb"
#
# advantage here is that the dirs can be expanded once on creation (or turned into Path objects, etc)

# SketchUp has something too?


# design point:
# - are the search paths expanded (relative to PWD) at time of creation, i.e., on `append` to PathSearch
# - or expanded when `resolve` is called (PWD maybe be changing)

        path = File.expand_path(path)  # Expand relative to working directory and clean
        if (not @search_paths.include?(path))
          @search_paths << path
