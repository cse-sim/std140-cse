# These validation checks are all stuff that could/should? come from an XML schema...
# Or at least this info will be duplicated in both places: a schema and here in the object logic.

# Use something to generate Ruby classes, or at least the methods, from an XSD.
#  try: https://github.com/rubyjedi/soap4r

# I can live with the duplication for now. There doesn't seem to be any good Ruby XSD code generation options.




# try to abstract XML processing to make it pluggable between Nokogiri and Ox (and REXML?).


# Problem:
# Want to keep the validators and helper stuff (look up time zone offset).
# But also need this to dynamically write to the target format.

# if the target format is being written _in this object_,
#  then this object has to know its parent: @document.

# This object (or someone else) needs to maintain a link to the native format object (@input_object or the XML node object).



# Two approaches:
# 1. The native format (e.g. IDF, gbXML) can be updated instantly every time something changes.
#    - This has benefit that don't get one big time-consuming hit at save time.
#    - Individual processing may slow down some things that could lead to bad user experience, like moving many zones at once--a lot gets updated.
#    - Output native text is immediately ready for inspection in Object Info.
#
# 2. The native formatting can be updated (i.e., dumped from Ruby object state) on request, such as save of document, or inspection of this object.
#    -

# Want to keep the native format writing code either in this class, or very nearby!
#  The format code gets overwritten in subclasses for EnergyPlus or gbXML.



# this does not convey the sense of writing to different formats.

    #def add_observer(&proc)
    # observers are called with a notification when values have changed.

    # observers tied to the parent document allow it to know when it's been modified!
