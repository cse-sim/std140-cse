# Good to keep this immutable. Always return a new Path object.
# A "path" is literally a path or route to a resource.
# Multiple paths can end up at ("resolve") to the same resource but the
# paths themselves are not equivalent:
#   a/b/../c != a/c
# The two paths may both point to c, they just get there by a different route.
# This becomes especially relevant when considering symbolic links.
# In the example above, if 'b' is a symlink, the paths may _not_ end up at the
# same resource.

#   accept anything that responds to to_path?
# how to handle no arg?
