# Changed my mind! I was reading some of my code and came across this:
#   elsif (field & "false")
# I didn't remember what it was. I thought it was a logical operation! Looks like boolean op.
# I think the other operator would be more memorable and intuitive:
#   elsif (field =~ "false")
# At least has a sense of equality or matching because of relationship to Regexp.


  # Monkey patching String to have a case-insensitive comparison operator.
  # & operator is currently not used by String.
  # Bit strange because bitwise and would normally return a value, not just true/false; not really comparison op
  # NOTE: I like the =~ syntax better, but the override only starts working correctly in Ruby 2.2+

    return(casecmp?(other))

  # Used by String, but feasible to override because "abc" =~ "Abc" currently fails with "TypeError: type mismatch: String given"; in other words, not used for String-String comparison.
  # Nice because =~ _looks_ like a comparison operator (although it returns a position index for regexps).
  # Suggests "approximately equal". Case-insensitive comparison is also a kind of pattern match.
  # The F# language (at least) uses the same thing. Can't find other precedence though.
  # def =~(other)
  #   puts "inside override"
  #   # return(99)

  #   if (other.kind_of?(String))
  #     result = casecmp(other).zero?
