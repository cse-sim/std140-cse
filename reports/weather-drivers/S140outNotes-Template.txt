===============================================================================
F. REPORT BLOCK FOR CHANGES TO SOURCE CODE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RUNNING THE
   TESTS, WHERE SUCH CHANGES ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN PUBLICLY RELEASED VERSIONS OF
   THE SOFTWARE.

CONTENT: This section shall describe changes to software source code made to
allow the software to run a test, where such changes are not available in a
publicly released version of the software.

INFORMATIVE NOTE: This section addresses special situations where a change to
source code is necessary to activate a feature or permit inputs needed for
a test when these features are not available in the publicly released version
of the software.

INSTRUCTIONS:  If changes to the source code for the purpose of running a test
are applied, separate notes to describe each source code modification shall be
provided. The standard format shown below and a separate number and title for
each note shall be applied. If changes to source code are not applied, specify
"NONE" in place of the information below.

NONE


===============================================================================
G. REPORT BLOCK FOR ANOMALOUS RESULTS
===============================================================================
CONTENT: Describing anomalous results shall be permitted, but is not required.
If anomalous test results are described, this section shall be used.

INSTRUCTIONS:  If anomalous test results are described, each type of anomalous
result shall be described in a separate note.  The standard format shown below
and a separate number and title for each note item shall be applied. If
anomalous results are not discussed, it shall be permitted to specify "NONE" in
place of the information below.

    The program uses elevation of the building site to calculate a fixed station pressure
    and air density.

NOTE 2 - Hourly Solar Radiation on Surfaces
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2.1 Test Case(s) and Specific Results from the Case(s) which are Anomalous:
    WD100: Sum of total, beam, and diffuse solar radiation incident on each surface [6.x.1.2]
    WD200: Sum of total, beam, and diffuse solar radiation incident on each surface [6.x.1.2]

    The program only generates these outputs at subhour levels. As such, the sum totals
    requested each hour will be identical to those requested in Section 6.x.1.3 for the
    horizontal roof surface.
