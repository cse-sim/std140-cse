      technique that represents heat capacity effects.

1.2.3 sfModel = FD

      gap convection, radiation. Representations are selected from a library to
      best match user-entered U-factor and SHGC. The matching library entry is
      then modified to produce the same U-factor and SHGC as input by the user.

===============================================================================
C. REPORT BLOCK FOR EQUIVALENT MODELING METHODS
===============================================================================
CONTENT: This section shall describe equivalent modeling methods used to perform
the tests.  When the software does not model an effect exactly as stated in the
Standard or does not permit the input values required, equivalent modeling
methods shall be permitted to perform the test.

INSTRUCTIONS:  If equivalent modeling methods are applied, a separate note for
each instance of equivalent modeling shall be provided.  The standard format
shown below and a separate number and title for each note shall be applied. If
equivalent modeling methods are not applicable, specify "NONE" in place of the
information below.


NOTE 1 - Window Modeling from U-factor and SHGC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 Describe the Effect Being Simulated:
    The program does not allow layer-by-layer input to define glazing details.
    Instead, the layer-by-layer details are inferred from NFRC rated U-factor
    and SHGC inputs.

1.2 Section(s) of the Standard where Relevant Inputs are Specified:
    5.2.1.11.2, 5.2.2.1.6.1.2, 5.2.2.1.7.1.2

1.3 Equivalent Input(s) Used:
    U-value and SHGC as listed in the respective informative glazing property
    tables.

1.4 Physical, Mathematical or Logical Justification of the Equivalent Input(s)
    provide supporting calculations, if relevant:
    NFRC ratings are more readily available than thermal and optical
    characteristics of windows. We do not require users to pre-process with
    LBNL's window software to arrive at an exact window representation.

===============================================================================
D. REPORT BLOCK FOR USE OF NON-SPECIFIED INPUTS
===============================================================================
CONTENT: This section shall describe non-specified inputs used to perform
the tests.  Use of non-specified inputs shall be permitted only for the
following specified sections relating to the following topics:

* Alternative exterior surface coefficients in Sections 5.2.1.9.3, 5.2.3.1.4.3,
  and 5.2.3.3.2
* Alternative interior surface coefficients in Sections 5.2.1.10.3, 5.2.3.1.4.4,
  5.2.3.2.2, and 5.3.1.9
* Alternative interior solar distribution fractions in Sections 5.2.1.12,
  5.2.2.1.2.2, 5.2.2.1.6.2, 5.2.2.1.7.2, 5.2.2.2.7.4, 5.2.3.9.3, 5.2.3.10.2,
  and 5.2.3.12.2
* Air density given at specific altitudes for the space cooling and space
  heating equipment cases in Sections 5.3.1.4.3, 5.3.3.4.3, and 5.4.1.4.3.


INSTRUCTIONS:  If non-specified inputs are applied, a separate note for each use
of non-specified inputs shall be provided.  The standard format shown below and
a separate number and title for each note shall be applied. If non-specified
inputs are not applied, specify "NONE" in place of the information below.


NONE

===============================================================================
E. REPORT BLOCK FOR OMITTED TEST CASES AND RESULTS
===============================================================================
CONTENT: This section shall describe test cases that were omitted and/or
individual results of test cases that were omitted along with the reason for
the omission.

INSTRUCTIONS:  If test cases were omitted, a separate note to describe each
type of omission shall be provided. The standard format shown below and a
separate number and title for each note shall be applied.  If there are no
omitted test cases, specify "NONE" in place of the information below.


NOTE 1 - Transmitted Solar Gain through west windows
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1.1 List the Case(s) where Results Were Omitted, and which Results Were Omitted
    for the Case(s):
    620: UNSHADED ANNUAL TRANSMITTED SOLAR RADIATION (west windows) [6.2.1.4.1]
    630: SHADED ANNUAL TRANSMITTED SOLAR RADIATION (west windows) [6.2.1.5.1]

1.2 Explanation for Omitting the Test Case(s) Results:
    The program does not allow output of transmitted solar through a single
    window (only for the total zone). (Note: South window outputs are post-
    processed from the total zone transmitted solar since there are no windows
    on other facades in those cases.)



===============================================================================
F. REPORT BLOCK FOR CHANGES TO SOURCE CODE FOR THE PURPOSE OF RUNNING THE
   TESTS, WHERE SUCH CHANGES ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN PUBLICLY RELEASED VERSIONS OF
   THE SOFTWARE.

allow the software to run a test, where such changes are not available in a
publicly released version of the software.

INFORMATIVE NOTE: This section addresses special situations where a change to
source code is necessary to activate a feature or permit inputs needed for
a test when these features are not available in the publicly released version
of the software.

INSTRUCTIONS:  If changes to the source code for the purpose of running a test
are applied, separate notes to describe each source code modification shall be
provided. The standard format shown below and a separate number and title for
each note shall be applied. If changes to source code are not applied, specify
